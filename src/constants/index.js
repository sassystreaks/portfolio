export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi! I’m Tarana S Shetty, a front-end developer who loves being in “React” mode. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I’m all about crafting clean, responsive web experiences.

I hold a B.E. in Information Science from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, where I didn’t just learn to code—I learned to code smart. At Hypersage Technology, I turned challenges into opportunities, optimizing performance and enhancing user experiences.

I’ve also led teams, organized events, and even orchestrated a hackathon or two. My leadership style is like debugging—clear, precise, and always aiming for the best solution.

When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new tech trends or dreaming up ways to make the web a better place. Let’s connect if you’re looking for someone who codes with passion and a dash of fun!.`;
